<h1><a id="Why_I_am_taking_this_class_0"></a>Why I am taking this class</h1>
<p>I am taking this class for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The chance to refresh skills I have not used in a while</li>
<li>The chance to learn new skills</li>
<li>With my current job as a program manager, I have very little opportunity to actually “do” DH work, so I think it’s important for me to carve out this time to be a DHer not a program manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the past ten years or so, beginning with my time as a graduate student at <a href="http://history.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers History Department</a>, I first began to develop my interest in DH, but I had no idea what it was.  In fact, no one in my department did.  When I asked my <a href="http://history.rutgers.edu/faculty-directory/98-bellany-alastair">advisor</a> if there would be support for me to learn something like <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/features/">GIS</a>, I was told no, but the department would want me to teach them if I learned.</p>

(My reaction)</p>
<p>So mostly I just poked around myself, teaching myself a few basic things like HTML &amp; CSS, incorporating a lot of <a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/home">digital</a> <a href="http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/">resouces</a> into my teaching, and exploring network analyses in my research.</p>
<p>At the end of my <a href="http://www.wlu.edu/">postdoc</a>, I decided I no longer wanted to pursue TT jobs anymore, and I began in earnest to explore altac opportunities.  Having been a member of the <a href="https://digitalhumanities.wlu.edu/">DH @ WLU</a> group during its founding year, I had come to realize that what I really hoped to be able to do was transition into DH full time.</p>
<p>And I did!</p>
<p>I moved to Boston, where I quickly (and luckily!), landed a job as the Communications and Outreach Coordinator at <a href="http://hyperstudio.mit.edu/">Hyperstudio</a>, the DH lab at MIT.  Hired to work mainly on <a href="http://www.annotationstudio.org/">Annotation Studio</a>, I had good fortune to work with a great group of people, learn some really awesome things, and work on some really cool projects!</p>

<p>All good things must come to an end, but that does not mean that other good things are not waiting for you just around the corner!  As the grant funding development on Annotation Studio (and me!) came to an end, I found myself in need of a new job.  I was luckily enough to find another awesome opportunity, this time at <a href="www.grinnell.edu">Grinnell College</a>, where I am now employed as their Associate Director of Academic Technology, running both instructional tech and our new <a href="http://dlac.sites.grinnell.edu/">Digital Liberal Arts Collaborative</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a great job, but as with most program manager jobs, the chances to get your hands dirty are few and far between.  I am excited about this class because it affords me the opportunity to do some good ol’ fashioned DH work!</p>
